# WorkSponsor

An interactive collection of all work sponsors in the Netherlands. WorkSponsor is for people in highly skilled professions like programming and product development to find jobs in the Netherlands.

The IND has a list of recognised work sponsors in NL on their website. WorkSponsor parses that document and allows anyone to filter through companies and find the perfect fit.
